## Overview

Whisker is a distributed localization, mapping, and control system for autonomous ground vehicles.  It uses a client-server model to offload the computational tasks of a fleet of vehicles to a central server.  This simplifies multi-vehicle coordination and reduces the cost, complexity, and power requirements of the vehicles.
